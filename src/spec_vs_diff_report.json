  "summary": "The diff implements both requirements successfully. REQ-1 (Jhajha Marathon branding update) is fully implemented in DeploymentInfo.tsx with the correct URL and QR code reference. REQ-2 (prizes loading fix) is addressed through improved error handling, retry logic, and proper data fetching in useQueries.ts and PrizesDisplay.tsx. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the code changes.",
