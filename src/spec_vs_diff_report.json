  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to PrizesDisplay.tsx that successfully implement both requirements. The component now displays prizes in a flat grid layout without category grouping headers, and there is no 'more prizes to be announced' section visible in the truncated code. The implementation maintains prize amounts and visual consistency.",

    {
      "description": "Added a prominent 'Medals for All Participants' banner section with animations and special styling",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly states constraints to preserve existing prize amounts and not modify the prize structure. The requirements focus only on removing category grouping and the 'more prizes' section. A new medals banner was not requested and appears to be an unsolicited addition that changes the prize display structure.",
