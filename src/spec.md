# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Simplify the prizes display by removing category grouping and the "more prizes to be announced" section.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove category headers and grouping from the prizes display
- Display prizes as a flat list showing only placement and amount
- Remove the "more prizes to be announced" section from the prizes page

**User-visible outcome:** Users see a cleaner, simplified prizes page showing only the confirmed prize placements (1st: ₹5000, 2nd: ₹3000, 3rd: ₹1000) without category divisions or placeholder text.
